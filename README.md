Title: Foodie’s Choice
Team Members:  Eric, Yubin, Tasnuva

Project Description: The Foodie will be able to search for a type of food they would like in their area. After clicking search a list of restaurants will be returned. As well as a list of recipes that they can make at home based on their search. This will allow the Foodie to decide if they want to go out to eat or stay at home. The results will be clickable to the actual recipe. For example there will be options to help limit their results that they can click on. Ie. limited recipe results by time, food allergies, number of reviews, limit by rating, etc.
